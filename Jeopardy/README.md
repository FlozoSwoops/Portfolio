Overview

For project I created a simple game of Jeopardy.

This one player game is designed so that once you arrive on the page you sign in and your username is displayed. After logging in the player then can select a catagory and point value, and based on there selection they are given a question. Once they answer the question correctly the point value will be added to their score. If they get the question wrong the value is subtracted from their value.
